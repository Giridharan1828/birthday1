    Last year , this same day , 6th October , we were different in places , not in the same way nor mind nor heart , but we existed side by side in class not knowing the lore which was about to come , we both took almost a year to find this eternal bonding , guess what ,is it all worth this take ? , WE KNOW THE WORTH OF WHAT WE HAVE , i know we cant even explain those , words cant even match the things we want to say , then where we go to express all we thought and think of all ? , i dont think will finish em up in this life line or even with immortality , coz you will add on the greets anyways , arghhhh this time sucks , running with its ass off every single time when im with you , cant that mf stay still when im with you 😭🙏, CRUELEST MF, but cant make him carry all coz he made everything to make happen to see you , GRATEFUL TOOOOOOOO , HE GAVE THE PUREST SOUL EVER TO EXIST , thanks my man for only giving me this kindest person on earth , thanks for not letting slip away , As we enter present timeline now , LIFE A'INT THE SAME SINCE I MET YOU , we know and said with each other, that when we met , we know ourselves that ,this isn't something we already had or usual , we both know that there's something else special within us, MAGIC ? or INSTINCT? , not probably , TRAUMAUS? , NVM!! . But there begun a spark of flame and love that will be never turn off even after eternity . We had experienced many things in our own lives , before we glued together , many things we never thought of , never deserved happening , especially DEAR , you had experienced many things that a'int meant for you ,but still you managed to move on and even when things and others shattered you to the bottom ,you kept coming back and made to give more love than before , never ever thought of bad to anyone , especially for the one who hurt you , you kept things morally even when everything fell apart , that's where MY GIRL stands for and stands with , as we move to the initial stages of our relationship ,idk you just spawned with the mass closeness for the first time , FIRST TIME for me ? GIRL , I barely speak with people , but it doesn't applied to you , guess what? , FUCKIN WORTH THE CHANGE , never ever thought i will get a bond this close to heart 😭😭😭U made my life more and more and ... special and beautiful to live in. Never ever forgot to blame myself for the things which happened to me and around ,no matter who's fault , I blamed myself for everything ever happened , arrghhhh , im an animal,I SAY ?!!!...,we never thought the first ,our first meet or interaction will mean us this much to point where we cant be without eachother , we barely know our first meet ig , not sure tho , but the things we made are great , hilarious, funny , terrible. Many fights ,as many as compromises ,a never ending story XD....   I hope ,you would have already read that hand written note i did write for you , it was abt our early stages of our talking , and scenic ones , more likely u may see duplicates too like repetition of events or same stuffs but i didn't much cared abt that , i just want to deliver it out of love and care😭😭🙏🙏lesse rewind our time line , if u like to? , even if not ...... then brutal forcing will be held on (VALUKATTAAYAM BTW☺️☺️), this part of journey started after we left AV's home and we have to return to each other's home , After several days of separation we got a chance to meet at AV's house , we didn't care abt no one excitement and involvement , even Av wouldn't be that much excited but we were to see each other , many days of calls and texts , many many dry days of life but we couldn't be there , side  by side to console each other , striving for each other , hoping one day will get that chance of meeting again and soon ... , one day we got opportunity for meeting in the name of "GROUP'S HANGOUT" , but only we know , we aint came for group purpose and we had our own purpose nu😁,even before that we had slightest argument nu , but when we met each other , everything faded , love over coated everything ,THATS THE REAL ONE !!! , even after many chaos , many fighting , many misunderstanding , after everything we still standing here on , thats what makes us stand tall and proud and loved ig, WE FIGHT , WE FED UP , WE CALM , WE CONSOLE , WE BACK , AS THE SAME AS BEFORE , WITH EVEN MORE PROGRESS ON US!!! ,yeapp once again to our events , we had a greatest and joyful time in time in her house , idc abt others WE HELD TO HAVE A GREAT TIME TOGETHER ... what else i care other than you ,you meant to me and only you , starting our day with a little fight , i was present a day before in gogul's house and i couldn't able to contact you , then the next day morning , you said you will come asa i come there , but arrived earlier u get come a bit later , i can still remember that you wore a BLACK DRESS WITH FLOWERS DESIGN ON ,THE PINKISH RED AND THE CREAMY FLOWERS... no way it leaving my mind anyday , anytime , can still see that day through my eyes i always do , once we came u didn't present there , so we got inside and we were in the room , then there come you , flashing and making the entire environment brightened , you opened the door waving and waving everyone with  those beautiful killing smile , arghhhh how can you even be this beautiful😭😭😭🙏🙏deeply concerned btw ... will deal this later on.Yeah then my girl showed up and guess what , everything became cool and lovely , the boring talks brightened , those silence filled with joy and laughter , the still windows and curtains pulled cool breeze and wind out of nowhere , but ik how they did that , honestly , they didn't , YOU DID!!! , had a great time laughing with people around you , then asap i got a chance , i came sat around you , we both shared things and laughs and things we couldn't fully on texts 😩😩but only in real time , had many things and we did got down , played hide and seek , and the most personal and favourite part for me down there?? IT'S THE SWING RIDE  ,we both swinged together like we own the place , that's a great time , I GOT MY EYES ON YOU THE WHOLE DAY , we had a great joy time down there , we watched them club us together right infront of each other , but our INTENTIONS WERE FINE AS HELL "WE ARE ONLY FRIENDS AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT "😂😂😂😂... then we went for eating ,u didn't even eat your fav dish biryani properly ,giving all your chickens to me and saying you are in diet uhhh , we sat side by side eating , giggling with hearing all the gossips spoken abt us , and the most beautiful moments , we were in the other room , where we played plenty games , that aint a big deal , but the one i loved most is the part where you combed my hair and decorated with bands and taking clips and THE MOST LOVELIEST PART IS THAT YOU POSTED THAT IN YOUR STORY WITH THE PRETTY LITTLE BABY SONG 🙃🙃🙃🤌🤌You accidentally beat me (not an accident XD...) and somehow most of them in the room saw that , and they all were arguing with u why did u beat him ?? how can u touch him?? BLAH BLAH BLAH... but none actually cared , all they wanted is to have fun by using us , and u went off for that , and i made you replenish again and we rocked again , we played games together and we done every thing together and there came the hard part , we have to separate part for again 🙃🙃🙃 we had to make our hearts heavy for once again , coz there isn't a near time to meet again  , the brightness which shined and the fragrance which spread slowly lost their power of transmission. IK and i can still remember the moments we shared at the end of the day , you were in the room ,standing with a heavy heart , i came by and we both know , we dying to be there forever together , side by side , both physically as well as mentally.. Anyways we had to leave and this time i patted your head with everything and each fragment of affection towards , and YES i had leave earlier , coz anyways i aint a belonger there tho ,SHIT!!!,...And after we both got a new instinct , that we both cant live without each other ,YES WE DID , many fights , many reassurances , everything we had was many and to each extent , we gained more evil eyes than compliments it selves , i can never completer this paragraph of writing about you , I SAID I CAN NEVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE  , all this are just for things happened so far , we got a load and endless n number of things to held , i can never in my entire life ,but when i turn back and look at the things we built ,i never actually have to write abt those all , cause im still gonna be there with you and our creation still goes on ,so that i get to know , this isn't something TEMPORARY AND THE HYPED DOWNFALL TO WITNESS , we built this castle slow and steady , not with rapidness ,not in the urge , not in lust , just a magical one which never decays even after eternity , that's how we meant to live ... I CAN STAY UP ALL DAY AND RECITE ABOUT YOU WITHOUT BEING TIRED OF and nothing can stop me from that except YOU , with you i will start again to make things beautiful and magnificent to write about later , SO IT'S A NEVER ENDING LOOP OF ACTION!!!and yes but lemme give you a break about coz you need rest from me anyways😭😭🙏BUT DONT YOU DARE IM GONNA STOP WRITING ABOUT YOU , IT WILL NEVER STOP ,JUST A SMALL BREAK TO YOU ☺️☺️🫂AND LEMME WRAP THIS UP NOW ,Today is your day, the day you came into this world and made it brighter without even knowing. Months later I arrived, but you were already there, already the reason my world started to make sense. I watch you carry so much, fight through pain no one sees, and still give love like it’s the easiest thing you know. That strength of yours, that kindness that never breaks, it’s the kind of beauty that stops time. I don’t want to just say happy birthday like it’s some simple thing, because you are anything but simple. You deserve a love so deep it never fades, a peace so strong it holds you even when everything falls apart. I don’t know what the future holds, but I know this much—because you exist, my life has meaning I never knew before. I see you in every quiet moment, every laugh, every tear. I want you to know I am here for all of it, for every broken piece and every bright flame you carry inside. Loving you isn’t a choice, it’s my breath, my heartbeat, my everything. So on this day, your birthday, I promise to hold you like the rarest treasure, to cherish every part of you. Because you are my home, the calm in the chaos, the love that never runs out. I don’t just want forever with you, I want every second because of you. Happy birthday my love, you are everything I never knew I needed and everything I’ll never stop fighting for. And with a short poem , I will conclude all this for now 😁😁🫂🫂
        <div class="message" style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #333; margin: 10px 0 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
  <p style="color: #9b30ff;">On 06.10, the skies were mild,</p>
  <p>The world just met its softest child.</p>
  <p>No cheers were heard, no grand parade,</p>
  <p>But something rare was gently made.</p><br>

  <p>Months went by — then I arrived,</p>
  <p>Unaware our paths would be aligned.</p>
  <p>You came first, like dawn through night,</p>
  <p>And I just followed toward your light.</p><br>

  <p>You learned to stand while I still crawled,</p>
  <p>But fate was patient, never stalled.</p>
  <p>It knew someday, we both would see,</p>
  <p>What time was saving — you for me.</p><br>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">So now each year this date appears,</p>
  <p>I smile through all the passing years.</p>
  <p>You came before — and yet it’s true,</p>
  <p>My life began the day I met you.</p><br>

  <p style="color: #9b30ff; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: bold;">With all my love and affection,</p>
  <p style="color: #ff1493;">I'm wishing you the happiest birthday, my dear! 🫂</p>
</div>


ONCE AGAIN , WITH ALL MY LOVE AND AFFECTIONS AND EVERYTHING I CARRY TILL THIS BREATH , WISHING YOU THE HAPPPIESSTTTT BIRTHDAYY MY DEAR AKSHAYAA🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂
